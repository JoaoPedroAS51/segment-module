# Debug

Enabling **Debug mode** allows you to see what happens when a method is called.
It also prevent the data from being send to **Segment source**.
This way, you don't have to spend your plan to be able to test.

Everything will be debugged in the console inside **Segment Analytics Debug** group.

```js
segmentAnalytics: {
  debug: true
}
```
